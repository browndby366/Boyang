<h4><strong>What is Building Energy Rating</strong></h4>
<p>
    The Energy Star Rating, also known as an energy efficiency score, is  that a building earns using the United States Environmental Protection Agency online benchmarking tool,
    <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/benchmark"> <strong>Energy Star Portfolio Manager</strong></a>, to compare building energy performance to similar buildings in similar climates. 
    EPA, in conjunctio n with stakeholders, developed this 1-100 ENERGY STAR score score2 as a screening tool, 
    where the higher the score, the better the energy performance of the building.
</p>
<p>
    As per Local Law 95 of 2019 grades based on Energy Star energy efficiency scores will be assigned as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>A – score is equal to or greater than 85</li>
        <li>B – score is equal to or greater than 70 but less than 85</li>
        <li>C – score is equal to or greater than 55 but less than 70</li>
        <li>D – score is less than 55</li>
        <li>F – for buildings that didn’t submit required benchmarking information</li>
        <li>N – for buildings exempted from benchmarking or not covered by the Energy Star program</li>
    </ul>
